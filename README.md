# Production_system
## ðŸŽ¯Objective:
Build a simple Production System capable of inferring new facts based on a set of predefined rules and initial facts using Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining techniques.
## ðŸ“Œ Key Points:
1. Read Rules and Facts from Files; parse both files and convert them into a structured format for processing:
    - provided with two text files: 
        - rules.txt: Contains all the production rules 
        - facts.txt: Contains a list of known initial facts. 
2. Implement Forward Chaining from scratch. 
3. Implement Backward Chaining from scratch. 
4. Print facts each cycle in two algorithms.
